newsreader-hadoop-components
============================

Introduction
------------
The Newsreader components in this directory have been slightly altered for use in combination with the newsreader-hadoop project: https://github.com/sara-nl/newsreader-hadoop

Changes
-------
All run.sh scripts have been modified and now, by default require two argumens: 

1. the absolute path to the component on a Hadoop slave node
3. the absolute path to a directory local to an Hadoop slave node that can be used for temporary or scratch files.
